/// <see cref="Entity.Position"/> is the top-left corner of the 8x8 body: the box collider is
/// corner-anchored, and the sprite anchors its frame's bottom-centre at that same pivot offset
/// from the corner, so the frame covers the body facing either way and a Tiled point object's
/// coordinate is taken as that corner here. Anchoring an authored coordinate is each entity's own
/// convention.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The frame is drawn by a <see cref="SpriteRenderer"/> whose <see cref="SpriteRenderer.FlipX"/>
/// the walk direction sets, so one texture faces both ways. Flip and
/// <see cref="SpriteRenderer.Scale"/> both work about the frame's pivot, and the pivot is the
/// point <see cref="SpriteRenderer.Offset"/> puts on the body: at the feet, so a mirror is about
/// the body's horizontal centre and a squash-and-stretch keeps the feet planted — the squash
/// spreads into the floor instead of sinking through it, and the stretch grows upward.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// That squash-and-stretch is presentation and nothing more. Jumping and landing each throw the
/// sprite's scale off <see cref="Vector2.One"/> and it eases back; the collider keeps its 8x8 box
/// throughout, so a stretched player is no taller to the physics than a resting one.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The two collision filters are independent. <see cref="KinematicBody2D.BlocksOn"/> names what
/// stops the sweep — <c>solid</c> and <c>platform</c>, the layers the room's tiles are authored on
/// — while <see cref="Collider2D.Detects"/> names what the collider reports, which is <c>sensor</c>
/// alone: the player walks through a <see cref="Sensor"/> and says so. Contacts, jumps and landings
