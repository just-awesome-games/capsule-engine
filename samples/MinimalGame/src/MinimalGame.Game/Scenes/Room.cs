/// The playable room: a scene that is a document and a class at once. The document is
/// <c>src/asset-sources/scenes/room.scene.json</c>, which the build validates and re-emits to
/// <c>assets/scenes/room.scene.json</c> beside the executable; <c>[SceneDocument("room")]</c> names
/// it, and without the attribute the kebab-cased class name would be the document name anyway. The
/// <see cref="SceneContent"/> constructor is the claim — a scene with one is composed from its
/// document, entry by entry in file order: the tile map first, then the <c>player</c> and
/// <c>sensor</c> placements.
/// <para>
/// This class is the code half of that scene: which camera it installs, and what quitting means.
/// The camera's own framing lives in <see cref="GameCamera"/>, not here.
/// <c>hall.scene.json</c> is the contrasting case — a document claimed by no class at all, which
/// still loads and plays as a plain <see cref="Scene"/>.
